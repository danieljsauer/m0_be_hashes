# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Syntax. I had to tinker with formatting quite a bit, particularly in the first hashes assignment.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Solving on my own. I learned how to call upon a specific symbol within  the hash by exeprimenting.
